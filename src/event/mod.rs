    /// This is an unsafe trait method. It's important to understand that in the case of unsafe
    /// trait methods, the implementer is given *extra guarantees* - it is the caller that is
    /// "unsafe," not the implementer. However, any unsafe operations that are performed inside the
    /// implementation must be sound only in the presence of those additional guarantees and
    /// guarantees the implementer can provide; the implementer cannot assume additional guarantees
    /// beyond those specified here.
    ///
    /// Specifically, when this method is called, these additional guarantees are made:
    ///
    /// No portion of the program will read from or write to this event, or any fields it
    /// holds exclusive, private ownership of, until after the event submitted with this
    /// SQE has been completed by the kernel. Therefore, if any owned data is shared with
    /// the kernel using this SQE, the kernel can be thought of as having "exclusive" ownership oer
    /// that data.
    // FIXME: These docs are not actually true, they gloss over the fact that we do call
    // cancellation and is_eager at certain points. They need to be worded more precisely.
